# DS 2002 Final Project
## By: Gabriel Jackson (tbp8gx)

This repository holds the tools used for my final project in DS2002. The data was used from the 'adventureworks' library, which can be found in /data/.
The project is located in the 'Final-Gabriel-Jackson.ipynb' Notebook, which contains more information about the project in its header (like the schemas, requirements, etc).
